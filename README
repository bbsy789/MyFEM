Introduction:

Base on variation principle and numerical anlaysis, there is a program by C/C++ language through the finite element method to compute structure mechanics problems.
It is not complete, currently still taking the time to complete.
I am a master student in mechanics engineering.
So this project maybe possess plenty of bugs. In the future, I will as far as possible get this project more complete. Thanks!

中文介绍：
这个程序采用了有限元法来计算结构力学问题，它的理论基础是变分原理和数值分析。
它还不完整，目前还在抽空完成中。我是机械工程硕士研究生。
所以这个项目可能有很多bug。将来，我会尽可能使这个项目更加完整。谢谢！
